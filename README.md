# Trello Card Creator - React App with Vite

## Overview

This React application, built using Vite, provides a user-friendly interface for creating cards in Trello. Leveraging the Trello API, you can seamlessly create cards and choose the section (list) where you want to add them. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of the app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/homosapian1999/Cloudify-Trello]
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd trello-card-creator
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

To use the Trello API for card creation, you need to obtain API keys and generate an access token. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the Trello Developer portal: [Trello Developer](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/).

2. Create an application and note down the API Key and Secret.

3. Generate an Access Token for your app.

4. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and add your Trello API credentials as follows:

```env
VITE_API_KEY=Your Key
VITE_TOKEN_KEY=Your Token
VITE_BOARD=Board Id

```

## Running the App

Start the development server to run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser. You can access it at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Using the App

1. Launch the application and log in with your Trello account if prompted.

2. Choose the Trello board where you want to create a card.

3. Select the list (section) within the board where you want to add the card.

4. Fill in the card title and description.

5. Click the "Create Card" button to add the card to the selected list.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that your API keys, secret, and access token are correctly configured in the `.env` file.
